# The Game Loop - Base Models

This repository contains 3D models created in Blender for "The Game Loop" project.

## Overview

This collection includes base 3D models and assets that are used throughout The Game Loop project. All models are created using Blender and are optimized for game development purposes.

## Contents

This repository contains various 3D models and assets used throughout The Game Loop project. All models are organized in the `models/` directory.

## File Format

All models are saved in Blender's native `.blend` format, which preserves:
- Geometry and mesh data
- Materials and textures
- Lighting setups
- Animation data (if applicable)
- Modifier stacks

## Usage

To use these models:

1. Open the `.blend` files in Blender (version 3.0 or higher recommended)
2. Export to your desired format (FBX, OBJ, glTF, etc.) for integration into your game engine
3. Ensure proper scaling and optimization for your target platform

## Requirements

- Blender 3.0+ (recommended for full compatibility)
- Basic knowledge of Blender for model modification and export

## Contributing
